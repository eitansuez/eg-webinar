# Takeaways

- Envoy Gateway has come a long way.

    When [Matt Klein announced](https://blog.envoyproxy.io/introducing-envoy-gateway-ad385cc59532) a collaboration between multiple vendors (Tetrate, Ambassador labs, VMware..) to create an open source foundation for Envoy-based gateway solutions, the project was just getting started.

- EG recently reached the v1.0 milestone and is now fully conformant implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway API.

- EG achieves its objective of unlocking the capabilities of [envoyproxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), and making it easy to deploy and configure in a cloud-native environment.

- There's *a lot* of goodness to unpack.

    We scratched the surface exploring only a few example scenarios.
    The Envoy Gateway [tasks section](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/docs/tasks/) provides recipes for dozens of traffic management and security scenarios.

- This was only an introduction to Envoy Gateway.

    Besides the various routing and security configuration scenarios, it's important to explore other facets of EG, including operations and observability.
